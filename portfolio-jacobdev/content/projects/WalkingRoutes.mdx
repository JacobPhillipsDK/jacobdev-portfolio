This project is a Python-based web application designed to visualize the A* algorithm in generating walking routes within Aalborg, Denmark. The app allows users to customize their route preferences and features a virtual street view for an immersive experience. It integrates OpenStreetMap data for route mapping and Mapbox JS for real-time map rendering, offering users an interactive interface.

### Project Highlights:

- **Pathfinding Visualization:** Implemented the A* algorithm to calculate optimal walking routes based on user preferences.
- **Real-time Mapping:** Integrated OpenStreetMap data with Mapbox for dynamic map rendering within the application.
- **Interactive User Experience:** Enabled a street view mode to let users virtually walk the generated routes.
- **Backend Integration:** Developed a FastAPI backend to handle route calculations and data processing.
- **GeoJson Data Processing:** Leveraged GeoJson to effectively manage route and map data for enhanced performance and usability.
