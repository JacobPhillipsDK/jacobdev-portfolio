This project is a full-stack web application I built to practice using Next.js and React. It tracks food discounts in supermarkets around Aalborg, Denmark, including Føtex, Salling, Netto, and Bilka. The app is powered by a PostgreSQL database, served through FastAPI, and hosted on my personal cloud server.

### Project Highlights:

-- **Full-stack Development**: Built a web application to monitor food discounts across Salling Group supermarkets (Føtex, Netto, Bilka, Salling).
-- **Data Processing & Storage:** Created Python workflows to collect and store daily product and price data from the Salling API in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Front-end Design:** Developed a responsive user interface with React and Next.js, using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **RESTful API:** Built a FastAPI backend to connect the front end with the database.
- **Automated Updates:** Wrote Python scripts to update the database daily with the latest discount information.
