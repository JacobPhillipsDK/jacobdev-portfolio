This website is a project that I made to learn how to use Next.js, with React. The website finds food discounts in Aalborg City, Denmark, from Føtex, Salling, Netto, and Bilka. The website is made with Next.js and FastAPI, and the database is postgreSQL. The website is hosted on my own cloud server
