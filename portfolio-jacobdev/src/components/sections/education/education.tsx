        "Using a combination of Machine Learning, specifically ResNet, I developed a model to recognize and analyze Street View images, achieving over 90% accuracy in image recognition.\n" +
        "To model optimal walking routes, I applied the A* algorithm in a node system, allowing for pathfinding that adapted to user-defined preferences. " +
        "The results demonstrated successful identification of preferred walking routes, effectively combining image recognition with weighted pathfinding to meet user needs. \n" +
        "All of this was implemented in a FastAPI REST API, providing a user-friendly interface for route generation and customization, the user also had the opportunity see and walk the suggested route virtually in a street view experience."

    thesis: "In my bachelor thesis, titled Comfortable Hand Gestures for Movement in Virtual Reality, I conducted a hand-gesture elicitation study to identify suitable gestures for locomotion control within a virtual reality environment. This project aimed to improve VR movement gestures, specifically continuous and teleportation gestures, using an elicitation-based approach.\n" +
        "Key research areas included defining gesture types, applying Wobbrok's study method with Morris' modifications, and minimizing legacy bias in user-generated gestures." +
        " The study involved 30 participants in both the elicitation study and a post-test, utilizing a logging system and NASA-TLX survey to assess task load.\n" +
        " The results indicated that gestures derived from the elicitation study had a lower task load index than industry-standard gestures, leading to discussions on the optimal number of gestures before quality declines. Additionally, I implemented software that could recognize these gestures in real-time within the virtual reality environment.",
